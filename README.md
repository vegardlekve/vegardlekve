# Hi there!

## My name is Vegard and I'm curruntly studying to become a web developer.


Through my studies in front end design at Noroff, I'm learning how plan, design and program web sites.
There has been a steep learning curve, since I had no knowledge about programming before. 
In my first year at Noroff, we had the following courses/projects:

- Design 1 
- Web	and	Communications	Technology
- HTML and CSS
- Project	Methodology
- Semester	Project	1
- Programming	Foundations
- JavaScript	1
- Interaction	Design
- Content	Management	Systems
- Exam	Project		1
- Portfolio	1

Feel free to look through my projects.
